# Next Firebase Auth
A Next.js starter kit that uses Firebase Email Link for simple and secure passwordless login.

# Features
* File based routing using `/app` dir.
* Styled using **tailwindcss**.
* Firebase Email Link authentication.
* Server-side rendered user authentication.
* Firebase local emulator.
* Code is written in **TypeScript**.
* Api routes.
* Server and client components.

## Important Notice: Unstable Releases
> **Warning**
> Using `redirect` with the  `try-catch` method or `.then/.catch`  results in a `NEXT_REDIRECT` error which is expected, but it does not redirect. See [issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/49964).

## Coming soon
- [ ] Signup/Signin with other login providers.

__âš  Because we are using the Auth Emulator in Firebase, you won't receive a sign-in email link in your email. Instead, please check the emulator logs after submitting your email for signing in or signing up to obtain the link. All sign-in and sign-up operations will be completed through the web.__
